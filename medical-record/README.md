# Medical Record Microservice

## 1. Microservice Overview

This microservice is designed for creating medical records for pets. Only authorized pet owners (authenticated via a JWT token) can add medical records. The microservice validates whether the owner has permission to create records for the pet (by comparing the `responsibleId` in the JWT token with the `responsibleId` associated with the pet).

### Microservice Flow

1. The pet owner authenticates and receives a JWT token.
2. The `responsibleId` from the token is compared with the `responsibleId` in the petâ€™s record.
3. If validation succeeds, the medical record is created for the pet.
4. If an error occurs (e.g., invalid token or unauthorized), an appropriate error is returned.

## 3. Microservice Functionality

### Creation Flow

- When a pet owner wants to create a medical record, a `POST` request is sent with the `petId` and medical details.
- The JWT token is validated to ensure the owner has permission to add the record for the pet.
- If valid, the record is stored in the database and returned to the client.

### Error Handling

- **Invalid Token:** If the JWT token is invalid, a 401 error is returned.
- **Missing Fields:** If the request is missing required fields, a 400 error is returned.
